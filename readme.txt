Assignment 4 contains a class called Complex and a class called Set.
A Complex number stores an integer with another integer represantation of an imaginary number. 

A Set is essentially an array of Complex numbers. Our implementation uses a fixed size array, while using an integer to keep track of where the end of the values are. This is necessary since we're using a fixed size array. 

To use the program with the given driver, simply navigate to the root directory of the assignment, and type "make" into the terminal to compile.
To run, type "./exec" into the terminal. 

The given driver demonstrates the handling of potentially erroneous conditions, as well as the overall functionality of the overloaded operators for the given classes.
